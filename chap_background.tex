\section{Background}
Based on the previous work of people using NSGA-II on some multi-objective optimization problems\cite{Magnier_2010_Multiobjective}, we believe we can also applied NSGA-II on our Urban Design Model to find the optimal solution. 

\section{Previous Work}

\subsection{Genetic Algorithm(GA)}
After the Genetic Algorithm was introduced in 1975 by John Henry Holland\cite{Holland_1975_Book}, it has been applied in many areas. With mimicking the process of natural selection, GA uses selection, crossover, and mutation to generate solutions and try to find the optimal solution for our problems. 

\subsection{Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II(NSGA-II)}
NSGA-II\cite{NSGA-II} is a very famous multi-objective optimization algorithm which is wide used  to find the optimal solution nowadays. Compare with the previous NSGA, NSGA-II has improved the computational efficiency, elitism, and sharing parameter. For computational complexity of nondominated sorting, it improve from \(O(MN^{3})\) to \(O(MN^{2})\). With the elitism, NSGA-II could not only speed up the GA performance, but also prevent loss of good solutions. Moreover, NSGA II does not need to specify a sharing parameter \(\sigma_{share}\), which is a requirement for pervious multi-objective evolutionary algorithms.
