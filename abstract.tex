In your thesis document, you should have a good abstract that can answer the following questions: (1) What is the problem you worked on, (2) Why is it interesting or motivation for working on this problem, (3) How did you achieve the solution or What did you do?, and (4) How well did your idea work out?

In the past century, there are thousands of cities have been built around the world. At the same time, more and more city environmental drawbacks have been came out, such as, heat island effect, air pollution problem, etc. In our research, we are trying to apply Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II(NSGA-II) to find the Pareto Optimal Solutions of Urban Design Optimization Problem. In addition, since NSGA-II especially gives a good performance on solving dynamic variables involved problem, we are interested to see how well it could deal with dynamic variables(e.g., wind, sunshine, temperature, etc.) in Urban Design Optimization Problem. To solve this problem, we implement and modify NSGA-II and expect that it could give us multiple Pareto Optimal Solutions and help us to make a better decision.
