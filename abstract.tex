In your thesis document, you should have a good abstract that can answer the following questions: (1) What is the problem you worked on, (2) Why is it interesting or motivation for working on this problem, (3) How did you achieve the solution or What did you do?, and (4) How well did your idea work out?

We are trying to apply Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II(NSGA-II) to find the Pareto Optimal Solutions of our Urban Optimization Problem. There are different types of Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithms(MOGA), based on the previous research \ciet{NSGA-II}\cite{Magnier_2010_Multiobjective}, we are interested to see how NSGA-II works on our problem. To solve this problem, we implement and modify NSGA-II to fit our problem well. We expect that NSGA-II could give us multiple Pareto Optimal Solutions and help us to make a better decision.
